# Week-1
Machine Learning basics and Google Colab for Week 1 of AICTE Internship

# Week 1 - Machine Learning Basics

## Description:
This repository contains the work completed for **Week 1** of the **AICTE Internship Program**. In this week, we covered the basics of **Machine Learning (ML)**, including an introduction to the key concepts of supervised learning algorithms, regression, and classification. We also explored hands-on examples using Google Colab to practice reading data, importing libraries, and exploring datasets.

### **Tasks Completed:**
1. **Understanding Machine Learning (ML)**:
   - Defined what ML is and its real-world applications.
   - Discussed how ML uses historical data to predict outcomes for new data.

2. **Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm**:
   - Explained what supervised learning is.
   - Discussed how it uses labeled data to train models and make predictions.

3. **Regression and Classification**:
   - Defined **regression** as a problem of predicting continuous values.
   - Defined **classification** as a problem of predicting categorical labels.

4. **Google Colab Notebook**:
   - Created a Google Colab file that:
     - Imports the necessary libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
     - Uploads a dataset.
     - Reads the data using `read_csv()`.
     - Displays the first 5 rows of the dataset.
     - Prints the dataset info (e.g., column types, non-null counts).

### **Files in this Repository:**
- **week1_ML_Basics.docx**: A Word document containing the written content for Week 1, including explanations on ML, supervised learning, regression, and classification.(raw file)
- **week1_ML_Basics.pdf**: A PDF version of the Word document, containing the same content on ML, supervised learning, regression, and classification.
- **week1_colab.ipynb**: A Google Colab notebook with the code to upload a dataset, read it, and display basic information about the data.

### **How to Run the Colab Notebook:**
1. Open the `week1_colab.ipynb` file in Google Colab.
2. Upload your dataset when prompted (ensure your dataset is in a CSV format).
3. Run each cell to see the output of the dataset reading and info printing.

# Week 2
Machine Learning Model Implementation and Evaluation for Week 2 of AICTE Internship

## Week 2 - Machine Learning Model Implementation and Evaluation

### Description:
This repository contains the work completed for **Week 2** of the **AICTE Internship Program**. In this week, we learned how to implement machine learning models using **scikit-learn**. We explored **model training**, **evaluation metrics**, and **cross-validation**. Additionally, we worked on applying regression and classification algorithms to real-world datasets.

### **Tasks Completed:**
1. **Implementation of Machine Learning Models:**
   - Implemented regression models such as **Linear Regression**.
   - Implemented classification models such as **Logistic Regression** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**.
   - Trained the models on a dataset and made predictions.

2. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated the models using performance metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and **RÂ² score**.
   - Used **confusion matrix** for classification tasks.
   
3. **Cross-Validation:**
   - Performed **k-fold cross-validation** to improve model accuracy and reduce overfitting.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Introduced **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter optimization to find the best parameters for the models.

5. **Visualization:**
   - Visualized the model performance and results using **matplotlib** and **seaborn**.

### **Files in this Repository:**
- **week2_colab.ipynb**: A Google Colab notebook where the following tasks are implemented:
  - Data loading and preprocessing.
  - Model training (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, KNN).
  - Model evaluation with performance metrics.
  - Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.

### **How to Run the Colab Notebook:**
1. Open the `week2_colab.ipynb` file in Google Colab.
2. Upload your dataset when prompted (ensure your dataset is in a CSV format).
3. Run each cell to:
   - Train the models.
   - Evaluate their performance using various metrics.
   - Visualize the results.
